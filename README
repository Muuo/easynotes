So far, I haven't done much. I've managed to get input and output using
portaudio. Still haven't managed to get a copy of the array storing the
recording into the main function. Once I manage to do this... it will
be possible to pass this array to the fft routine(mfft).

Once I'm able to obtain the results of the fft(fast fourier transform)
of the recording, it will be possible to analyze it and extract
frequencies... and eventually notes and timing of said notes.

I've managed to read the array from recorded.raw. Now all that's left 
is passing the array to mfft and so on and so forth.

I can now pass multiple windows to mfftw without errors. I think I now
need to prioritise getting a graphing system online so I can visualise
the data and get rid of the 2-channel issue.

I can now write the recorded data to a wav file using libsndfile and 
read said data using python. I have sucessfully used matplotlib to 
display a spectrum. However, I have realized that it might be easier 
to just use audacity. Now I have to split the channels in main.c and
find a nice way to display the fft data.
Muuo. In God I trust :-)
